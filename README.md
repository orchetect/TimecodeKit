The most robust, precise and complete Swift library for working with SMPTE/EBU timecode. Supports 22 industry timecode frame rates, with a suite of conversions, calculations and integrations with Apple AV frameworks.

Timecode is a broadcast and post-production standard for addressing video frames. It is used for video burn-in timecode (BITC), and display in a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or video playback/editing applications.

> [!TIP]
> See the TimecodeKit 1.x ‚Üí 2.x [Migration Guide](https://orchetect.github.io/TimecodeKit/documentation/timecodekit/timecodekit-2-migration-guide) if you are moving from TimecodeKit 1.x.

## Supported Timecode Frame Rates

The following timecode rates and formats are supported.

| Film / ATSC / HD | PAL / SECAM / DVB / ATSC | NTSC / ATSC / PAL-M | NTSC Non-Standard | ATSC |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- | ---- |

## Supported Video Frame Rates

The following video frame rates are supported. (Video rates)

| Film / HD | PAL       | NTSC            |
| --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 23.98p    | 25p / 25i | 29.97p / 29.97i |
| 24p       | 50p / 50i | 30p             |
| 47.95p    | 100p      | 59.94p / 59.94i |

| 96p       |           | 120p            |

## Core Features

- Convert timecode between:
  - timecode display string
  - total elapsed frame count
  - real wall-clock time
  - elapsed audio samples at any audio sample rate
  - rational time notation (such as `CMTime` or Final Cut Pro XML and AAF encoding)
  - feet + frames
- Convert timecode and/or frame rate to a rational fraction, and vice-versa (including `CMTime`)
- Support for Days as a timecode component (some DAWs including Cubase support > 24 hour timecode)
- Support for Subframes
- Math operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Granular timecode validation
- Form a `Range` or `Stride` between two timecodes
- Conforms to `Codable`
- A `Formatter` object that can format timecode
- A `NSAttributedString` showing invalid timecode components using alternate attributes (such as red text color)
- A SwiftUI `Text` object showing invalid timecode components using alternate attributes (such as red text color)
- `AVAsset` video file utilities to easily read/write timecode tracks and locate `AVPlayer` to timecode locations
- Exhaustive unit tests ensuring accuracy

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

1. Add TimecodeKit as a dependency using Swift Package Manager.
   - In an app project or framework, in Xcode:
     - Select the menu: **File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency...**
     - Enter this URL: `https://github.com/orchetect/TimecodeKit`
   - In a Swift Package, add it to the Package.swift dependencies:

     ```swift
     .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/TimecodeKit", from: "2.0.0")
     ```
2. Import the library:
   ```swift
   import TimecodeKit
   ```
