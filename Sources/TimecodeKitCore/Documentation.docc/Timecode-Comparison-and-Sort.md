# Comparison & Sort

Comparing and sorting the ordering of timecodes.

## Comparable Conformance

Comparable protocol conformance.

Two ``Timecode`` instances can be compared linearly using common comparison operators.

```swift
try Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24) 
    == Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24) // == true

try Timecode(.string("00:59:50:00"), at: .fps24) 
    < Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24) // == true

try Timecode(.string("00:59:50:00"), at: .fps24) 
    > Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24) // == false
```

## Comparing using Timeline Context

Special comparison methods based on non-zero timeline origin timecode.

Sometimes a timeline does not have a zero start time (00:00:00:00). For example, many DAW applications such as Pro Tools allow a project start time to be set to any timecode. Its timeline then extends for 24 hours from that timecode, wrapping over 00:00:00:00 at some point along the timeline.

For example, given a 24 hour limit:

- A timeline start of 00:00:00:00 @ 24fps:

  24 hours elapses from 00:00:00:00 → 23:59:59:23

- A timeline start of 20:00:00:00 @ 24fps:

  24 hours elapses from 20:00:00:00 → 00:00:00:00 → 19:59:59:23

  This would mean for example, that 21:00:00:00 is < 00:00:00:00 since it is earlier in the wrapping timeline, and 18:00:00:00 is > 21:00:00:00 since it is later in the wrapping timeline.

Methods to sort and test sort order of ``Timecode`` collections are provided.

Note that passing `timelineStart` of `nil` or zero (00:00:00:00) is the same as using the standard  `<`, `==`, or  `>` operators as a sort comparator.

```swift
let timecode1: Timecode
let timecode2: Timecode
let start: Timecode
let result = timecode1.compare(to: timecode2, timelineStart: start)
// result is a ComparisonResult of orderedAscending, orderedSame, or orderedDescending
```

## Sorting

Collections of `Timecode` can be sorted ascending or descending.

```swift
let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let sorted = timeline.sorted() // ascending
let sorted = timeline.sorted(ascending: false) // descending
```

These collections can also be tested for sort order:

```swift
let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let isSorted: Bool = timeline.isSorted() // ascending
let isSorted: Bool = timeline.isSorted(ascending: false) // descending
```

On newer systems, a `SortComparator` called ``TimecodeSortComparator`` is available as well.

```swift
let comparator = TimecodeSortComparator() // ascending
let comparator = TimecodeSortComparator(order: .reverse) // descending

let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let sorted = timeline.sorted(using: comparator)
```

## Sorting using Timeline Context

For an explanation of timeline context, see [Comparing using Timeline Context](#Comparing-using-Timeline-Context>).

Collections of ``Timecode`` can be sorted ascending or descending.

```swift
let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let start = try Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24)
let sorted = timeline.sorted(timelineStart: start) // ascending
let sorted = timeline.sorted(order: .reverse, timelineStart: start) // descending
```

These collections can also be tested for sort order:

```swift
let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let start = try Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24)
let isSorted: Bool = timeline.isSorted(timelineStart: start) // ascending
let isSorted: Bool = timeline.isSorted(order: .reverse, timelineStart: start) // descending
```

On newer systems, a `SortComparator` called ``TimecodeSortComparator`` is available as well.

```swift
let start = try Timecode(.string("01:00:00:00"), at: .fps24)
let comparator = TimecodeSortComparator(timelineStart: start) // ascending
let comparator = TimecodeSortComparator(order: .reverse, timelineStart: start) // descending

let timeline: [Timecode] = [ ... ]
let sorted = timeline.sorted(using: comparator)
```
