/// Industry-standard video frame rates.
/// Certain rates may be progressive or interleaved.
///
/// Timecode is way of encoding a frame number, therefore _timecode frame rate_ may be independent of _video frame rate_.
///
/// Part of common confusion with timecode can arise from the use of “frames per second” in both the timecode and the actual video frame
/// rate. When used to describe timecode, frames per second represents how many frames of timecode are counted before one second of timecode
/// increments. When describing video frame rates, frames per second represents how many literal video frames are played back during the
/// span of one second of real wall-clock time.
///
/// For example, 24p video typically uses 24 fps timecode rate.
/// However, 29.97p video may use 29.97 fps or 29.97-drop fps timecode rate depending on post-production facility requirements, and
/// timecode at these rates do not match wall-clock time exactly.
///
/// Some video rates may correspond (or generally be compatible with) certain timecode rates and vice-versa.
/// To return a video rate's corresponding timecode rate, see ``timecodeFrameRate(drop:)``.
