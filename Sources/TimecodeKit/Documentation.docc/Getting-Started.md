# Getting Started

Documentation and guides to get the most out of TimecodeKit.

Add the library to your app project or Swift package, and import it.

import TimecodeKit
```

The library provides UI components that may also be imported if desired.

```swift
import TimecodeKitUI
```

The documentation page for ``Timecode`` provides a quick overview of how to form timecode and convert to/from various other time values.

Example projects are located in the Examples folder to demonstrate usage of the library.

The topics list in the sidebar give overviews of specific areas of concern.
