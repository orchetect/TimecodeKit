# Getting Started

Documentation and guides to get the most out of TimecodeKit.

## Import

All modules in the library can be imported to your app project or Swift package using an umbrella import.

```swift
import TimecodeKit
```

If only certain modules are needed, they may instead be imported individually.

The library provides UI components that may also be imported if desired.

```swift
import TimecodeKitCore
import TimecodeKitAV
import TimecodeKitUI
```

## Using TimecodeKit

The documentation page for <doc://TimecodeKit/TimecodeKitCore/Timecode-swift.struct> provides a quick overview of how to form timecode and convert to/from various other time values.

Example projects are located in the Examples folder to demonstrate usage of the library.

The topics list in the sidebar give overviews of specific areas of concern, broken down by module.

If upgrading from TimecodeKit 1.x, see <doc:TimecodeKit-2-Migration-Guide>.
