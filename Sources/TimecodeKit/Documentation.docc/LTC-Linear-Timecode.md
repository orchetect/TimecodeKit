# LTC (Linear Timecode)

Information on LTC (Linear/Longitudinal Timecode).

LTC is an encoding of SMPTE timecode data in an audio signal, as defined in SMPTE 12M specification.

TimecodeKit does not implement LTC encoding or decoding directly.

Support may be added in future versions of TimecodeKit, or possibly in an audio library such as AudioKit.
